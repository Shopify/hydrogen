The user is asking me to analyze the entire release workflow in the Hydrogen repository and create a technical design document. They want me to:

1. Deep analyze the full release flow including all workflow files
2. Research how the legacy logic could be simplified with the CalVer integration
3. Create a tech design doc with clear human release process flows
4. Show current end-to-end release process for patch/minor and major releases
5. Goal: Less human manual interaction without sacrificing correctness
6. Less workflows and scripts relating to changesets and version control

Let me analyze what I've learned from the files:

Current Release Infrastructure

Workflow Files:

1. changesets-linter.yml - Lints changesets on PRs
2. changesets-reminder.yml - Reminds developers to add changesets when they modify packages
3. changesets.yml - Main release workflow (runs on main branch)
4. changesets-back-fix.yml - Handles releases for previous versions (2025-01 branch)

Key Components:

1. hydrogen-changelog-config.js - Custom changelog generation with GitHub integration
2. CalVer system - New quarterly versioning enforcement

Current Pain Points:

1. Manual updating of latestBranch in changesets.yml (line 32)
2. Complex changelog generation requiring GitHub tokens
3. Multiple manual steps for releases
4. No automation for determining release type
5. Manual oversight needed for version PR merging

Opportunities for LLM Agent Automation:

1. Automatic changeset generation from PR descriptions
2. Intelligent version bump determination
3. Automated release notes generation
4. Automated testing and validation
5. Smart notification and escalation

Let me create a comprehensive technical design document.
