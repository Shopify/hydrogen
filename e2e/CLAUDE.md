### The Golden Rule

**ðŸ”´ NEVER attempt to commit if:**

- Lint has errors or warnings
- TypeScript has type errors
- Tests are failing (unless that's the intended outcome)
- The implementation is incomplete

**ðŸŸ¢ ONLY commit when:**

- All validation checks pass
- The task is complete and working
- The code is production-ready

DO NOT commit or run any mutating git commands without explicit permission!!!
