I am going to close this chat session soon and you will lose all memory of this conversation. Please reflect on your progress so far and update the task list document (@docs/tasks/tasks-prd-automated-playwright-tests.md) with any details that would be helpful for you to perform the next steps in our plan more effectively. Anything that surprised you, anything that prevented your solution from working and required debugging or troubleshooting â€“ include it all. Do not go into specifics of the current task, no need for a progress report, focus on distilling your experience into a set of general learnings for the future.
