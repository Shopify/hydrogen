-# Hydrogen template: Skeleton
+# Hydrogen template: Metaobjects as CMS
 
-Hydrogen is Shopify’s stack for headless commerce. Hydrogen is designed to dovetail with [Remix](https://remix.run/), Shopify’s full stack web framework. This template contains a **minimal setup** of components, queries and tooling to get started with Hydrogen.
+This Hydrogen template demonstrates how to use Shopify Metaobjects as a content management system (CMS). Hydrogen is Shopify's stack for headless commerce, designed to work with [Remix](https://remix.run/), Shopify's full stack web framework.
+
+This template shows how to create a flexible, section-based content architecture using Shopify's native Metaobjects, allowing merchants to manage content directly from the Shopify admin without external CMS dependencies.

-- Minimal setup of components and routes
+- **Metaobjects-based CMS architecture**
+- **Dynamic section rendering system**
+- **Content management through Shopify admin**
+
+## Metaobjects Architecture
+
+This template implements a hierarchical content structure:
+
+```
+Route (Metaobject)
+  └── Sections (References)
+      ├── SectionHero
+      ├── SectionFeaturedProducts
+      ├── SectionFeaturedCollections
+      ├── SectionStoreProfile
+      └── SectionStoreGrid
+```
+
+### Key Features
+
+- **Route-based content**: Each route can have its own set of sections
+- **Reusable sections**: Create once, use across multiple routes
+- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with generated types
+- **Merchant-friendly**: Content managed directly in Shopify admin
+- **Extensible**: Easy to add new section types
 
 ## Getting started
 
 **Requirements:**
 
 - Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher
+- Shopify store with Metaobjects enabled
+- Metaobject definitions created in Shopify admin
 
 ```bash
 npm create @shopify/hydrogen@latest
 ```
 
+## Setting up Metaobjects
+
+1. **Create Metaobject definitions** in your Shopify admin:
+   - Navigate to Settings → Custom data → Metaobjects
+   - Create definitions for Route, SectionHero, SectionFeaturedProducts, etc.
+   - See `guides/metaobjects/README.md` for detailed field configurations
+
+2. **Create content entries**:
+   - Add Route entries for pages you want to manage
+   - Create Section entries and link them to Routes
+   - Configure section content and references
+
+3. **Query and render**:
+   - Routes automatically query their associated sections
+   - Sections component handles dynamic rendering based on type
+

+## Creating New Sections
+
+1. Define the Metaobject in Shopify admin
+2. Create a React component in `app/sections/`
+3. Add the GraphQL fragment for querying
+4. Register in the Sections component switch statement
+
+Example:
+```tsx
+export function SectionExample(props: SectionExampleFragment) {
+  const section = parseSection<...>(props);
+  return <section>...</section>;
+}
