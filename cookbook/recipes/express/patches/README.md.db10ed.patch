-# Hydrogen template: Skeleton
+# Hydrogen Express Skeleton
 
-Hydrogen is Shopify’s stack for headless commerce. Hydrogen is designed to dovetail with [Remix](https://remix.run/), Shopify’s full stack web framework. This template contains a **minimal setup** of components, queries and tooling to get started with Hydrogen.
+This is a Hydrogen skeleton template configured to run with NodeJS [Express](https://expressjs.com/) instead of Shopify Oxygen. 
+
+Hydrogen is Shopify's stack for headless commerce, designed to dovetail with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), the full stack web framework. This template contains a **minimal Express setup** with basic components and routes to get started with Hydrogen on Node.js.

 ## What's included
 
-- Remix
+- React Router 7
 - Hydrogen
-- Oxygen
+- Express server
 - Vite
-- Shopify CLI
+- TypeScript
 - ESLint
-- Prettier
-- GraphQL generator
-- TypeScript and JavaScript flavors
 - Minimal setup of components and routes
 
+## Important Notes
+
+This Express setup differs from the standard Hydrogen template:
+
+1. **Cache Implementation**: Uses an in-memory cache. In production, you should implement redis, memcached, or another cache that implements the [Cache interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache).
+2. **Storefront Redirect**: Does not utilize [`storefrontRedirect`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/hydrogen/utilities/storefrontredirect) functionality.
+3. **Minimal Routes**: Only includes index and product routes. Add more routes as needed.
+
 ## Getting started
 
 **Requirements:**
 
-- Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher
+- Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher (but less than 22.0.0)
+
+### Environment Setup
+
+Create a `.env` file with your Shopify store credentials:
+
+```env
+PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN="your-token"
+PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN="your-store.myshopify.com"
+PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_ID="your-storefront-id"
+SESSION_SECRET="your-session-secret-at-least-32-chars"
+```
+
+## Local development
+
+Start the Express development server:
 
 ```bash
-npm create @shopify/hydrogen@latest
+npm run dev
 ```
 
+This starts your app in development mode with hot module replacement.
+
 ## Building for production
 
 ```bash
 npm run build
 ```
 
-## Local development
+## Production deployment
+
+Run the app in production mode:
 
 ```bash
-npm run dev
+npm start
 ```
 
-## Setup for using Customer Account API (`/account` section)
+### Deployment
 
-Follow step 1 and 2 of <https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/building-with-the-customer-account-api/hydrogen#step-1-set-up-a-public-domain-for-local-development>
+When deploying your Express application, ensure you deploy:
+
+- `build/` directory
+- `server.mjs` file
+- `package.json` and dependencies
+- Your `.env` configuration
+
+The Express server runs on the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable (defaults to 3000).
+
+## Project Structure
