  This recipe shows you how to add support for multi-region and multilingual in
  Hydrogen.


  In this recipe you'll make the following changes:


  1. Create a component that displays a country selector.

  2. Create a data file that defines the countries and their locales supported
  by your store.

  3. Create a utility function that gets the locale from the request, and then
  inject it into the context.

  4. Create a localized product route.

  5. Create a localized action route that handles locale changes.
