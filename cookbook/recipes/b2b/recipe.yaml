title: B2B Commerce
summary: Add Business-to-Business (B2B) functionality with company locations,
  quantity rules, and volume pricing
description: |
  This recipe adds comprehensive B2B functionality to your Hydrogen storefront, enabling business customers to:

  - Select their company location for contextualized pricing
  - View and respect quantity rules (minimum, maximum, increment)
  - See volume-based price breaks for bulk purchases
  - Access B2B-specific pricing through contextualized GraphQL queries

  The implementation includes a location selector modal, quantity rule displays on product pages, 
  and cart functionality that respects B2B quantity rules. All product queries are contextualized 
  with buyer information (company location + customer token) to ensure accurate B2B pricing.
notes:
  - This recipe requires a Shopify Plus plan for B2B functionality
  - Your store must use new customer accounts (not classic accounts)
  - Only the product display page uses contextualized queries in this example
  - For production, all product queries should be contextualized with buyer
    information
  - The location selector appears automatically for customers with multiple
    company locations
requirements: |
  - Shopify Plus plan with B2B enabled
  - New customer accounts activated
  - At least one B2B company with customer access configured
  - Products with quantity rules or volume pricing configured (optional but recommended for testing)
