  "description": "This folder contains an example implementation of [infinite scroll](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/data-fetching/pagination#automatically-load-pages-on-scroll) within a product collection page using the [Pagination component](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/hydrogen/2024-07/components/pagination).\n\nThe example uses [`react-intersection-observer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intersection-observer) to detect when the `Load more` button is in view. A `useEffect` then triggers a navigation to the next page url, which seamlessly loads more products as the user scrolls.\n\nA few side effects of this implementation are:\n\n1. The page progressively enhances, so that when JavaScript has yet to load, the page is still interactive because the user can still click the `Load more` button.\n2. As the user scrolls, the URL automatically changes as new pages are loaded.\n3. Because the implementation uses the `Pagination` component, navigating back to the collection list after clicking on a product automatically maintains the user's scroll position.",
