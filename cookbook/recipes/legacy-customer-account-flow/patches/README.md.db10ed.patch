+## Legacy Customer Account Flow
+
+üö® **Caution**: This legacy authentication strategy will not maintain authentication between your Hydrogen storefront and checkout; for better support, use either the New Customer Accounts strategy or Multipass.
+
+This template includes the legacy customer account flow made with [Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront) which provides:
+- Full customer registration and login flow
+- Password recovery and reset functionality  
+- Account activation via email
+- Customer profile management
+- Order history and address management
+- Session-based authentication using customer access tokens
+
+**Note**: Passwordless login with [Customer Account API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/customer) (introduced Jan 2024) is Shopify's recommended way to build headless customer experiences. Consider migrating to the new API for better security and features.
