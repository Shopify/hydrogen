title: Multipass Authentication with Storefront API
summary: Enable Shopify Plus Multipass authentication using Storefront API for
  seamless customer login and checkout
description: |
  This recipe implements Shopify Plus Multipass authentication using the Storefront API instead of the Customer Account API.
  It provides session-based authentication with customer access tokens, enabling customers to maintain their logged-in
  state across the storefront and checkout process. This is particularly useful for Shopify Plus stores that need to
  integrate with external authentication systems or maintain customer sessions across different platforms.

  Key features:
  - Converts all customer account routes from Customer Account API to Storefront API
  - Implements session-based authentication with customer access tokens
  - Adds Multipass checkout button for seamless checkout experience
  - Provides token validation and automatic token refresh
  - Includes complete authentication flow (login, logout, register, recover, reset)
notes:
  - This recipe requires Shopify Plus as Multipass is a Plus-only feature
  - The recipe replaces the snakecase-keys npm package with a custom
    ESM-compatible implementation to work in Worker environments
  - All customer authentication is handled through Storefront API mutations
    instead of Customer Account API
  - Session tokens are validated on each request and automatically cleared if
    expired
requirements: |
  - Shopify Plus subscription for Multipass functionality
  - PRIVATE_SHOPIFY_STORE_MULTIPASS_SECRET environment variable must be set
  - React Router 7.9.x or higher

    - How do I set up Multipass authentication in my Hydrogen store?
    - How can I use Storefront API for customer authentication instead of
      Customer Account API?
    - How do I implement session-based authentication in Hydrogen?
    - How can I maintain customer login state across checkout?
    - How do I integrate external authentication with Shopify Plus?
  troubleshooting:
    - issue: "ReferenceError: require is not defined (snakecase-keys error)"
      solution: The recipe includes a custom ESM-compatible snake_case implementation.
        Ensure you're using the updated multipassify.server.ts file that doesn't
        import snakecase-keys
    - issue: PRIVATE_SHOPIFY_STORE_MULTIPASS_SECRET is undefined
      solution: Add the Multipass secret to your environment variables. You can find
        this in your Shopify Plus admin under Settings > Checkout > Multipass
    - issue: "TypeScript error: Property 'PRIVATE_SHOPIFY_STORE_MULTIPASS_SECRET' does
        not exist on type 'Env'"
      solution: The recipe adds this type definition to env.d.ts. Run 'npm run
        typecheck' after applying all patches
    - issue: Customer login redirects to Customer Account API login page
      solution: Ensure all account routes have been properly converted to use
        Storefront API. Check that account_.login.tsx uses the form-based login,
        not customerAccount.login()
    - issue: Multipass checkout button not appearing
      solution: Verify that CartSummary.tsx imports and uses MultipassCheckoutButton
        component, and that the cart.tsx route has been patched
