-## Setup for using Customer Account API (`/account` section)
+## Multipass Setup (Shopify Plus only)
 
-Follow step 1 and 2 of <https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/building-with-the-customer-account-api/hydrogen#step-1-set-up-a-public-domain-for-local-development>
+### Requirements
+
+- Multipass is available on [Shopify Plus](https://www.shopify.com/plus) plans
+- A Shopify Multipass secret token from [**Settings > Customer accounts**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/customer_accounts)
+- Ensure you have `Classic customer account` options selected to use Multipass
+
+### Configuration
+
+1. **Set environment variables** in your `.env` file:
+
+```env
+# Required for Multipass (Shopify Plus only)
+PRIVATE_SHOPIFY_STORE_MULTIPASS_SECRET=your_multipass_secret_here
+
+# Already configured by Hydrogen
+SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
+```
+
+2. **Dependencies** (already included):
+- `crypto-js@^4.2.0` - JavaScript library of crypto standards
+- `snakecase-keys@^9.0.2` - Convert object keys to snake case
+- `@types/crypto-js@^4.2.1` - TypeScript types for crypto-js
+
+### Key Multipass Files
+
+| File | Description |
+|------|------------|
+| [`app/components/MultipassCheckoutButton.tsx`](app/components/MultipassCheckoutButton.tsx) | Checkout button that passes customer session to checkout |
+| [`app/lib/multipass/multipass.ts`](app/lib/multipass/multipass.ts) | Client-side utility for multipass URL and token handling |
+| [`app/lib/multipass/multipassify.server.ts`](app/lib/multipass/multipassify.server.ts) | Server-side multipass token generation and parsing |
+| [`app/lib/multipass/types.ts`](app/lib/multipass/types.ts) | TypeScript types for multipass |
+| [`app/routes/account_.login.multipass.tsx`](app/routes/account_.login.multipass.tsx) | API route for multipass token generation |
+
+## Authentication System
+
+This template uses the **Storefront API** for customer authentication instead of the Customer Account API:
+
+### Account Routes
+- `/account/login` - Customer login
+- `/account/register` - New customer registration  
+- `/account/logout` - Logout
+- `/account/recover` - Password recovery
+- `/account/reset/:id/:token` - Password reset
+- `/account/activate/:id/:token` - Account activation
+- `/account` - Account dashboard
+- `/account/profile` - Edit profile
+- `/account/addresses` - Manage addresses
+- `/account/orders` - Order history
+
+### How Multipass Works
+
+1. Customer logs in using email/password
+2. Session stores `customerAccessToken`
+3. When checking out, multipass generates encrypted token
+4. Customer is automatically logged in at Shopify checkout
+
+### Fallback Behavior
+
+For non-Plus stores or when multipass isn't configured:
+- Checkout button works normally
+- Console shows: "Bypassing multipass checkout"
+- Customers use standard Shopify checkout flow
+
+## Troubleshooting
+
+### Multipass Issues
+
+**500 Error on checkout:**
+- Ensure `PRIVATE_SHOPIFY_STORE_MULTIPASS_SECRET` is set correctly
+- Verify you have a Shopify Plus plan
+- Check that Classic customer accounts are enabled
+
+**Customer not logged in at checkout:**
+- Verify customer is logged in first at `/account/login`
+- Check that multipass token generation is working
+- Ensure multipass secret hasn't expired
