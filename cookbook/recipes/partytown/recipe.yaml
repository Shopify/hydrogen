title: Partytown + Google Tag Manager
summary: Add Partytown web worker integration for Google Tag Manager to improve
  performance
description: |
  This recipe integrates Partytown with your Hydrogen storefront to run Google Tag Manager 
  and other third-party scripts in a web worker, keeping the main thread free for critical 
  rendering tasks. Compatible with React Router 7.9.x and the latest Hydrogen skeleton.

  Key features:
  - Moves GTM and analytics scripts off the main thread
  - Improves Core Web Vitals scores
  - Maintains full GTM functionality
  - Includes CORS reverse proxy for third-party scripts
  - CSP headers configured for GTM domains
notes:
  - Remember to set your GTM_CONTAINER_ID or GTM_ID environment variable
  - Run 'npm run partytown' to copy library files for production
  - TypeScript users need to manually add GTM types to env.d.ts
requirements: |
  - Google Tag Manager container ID
  - Basic understanding of web workers and CSP
  - Node.js 18.0.0 or higher

nextSteps: |
  After applying this recipe:

  1. Install dependencies:
     npm install

  2. Copy Partytown library files:
     npm run partytown

  3. Add your GTM container ID to .env:
     GTM_CONTAINER_ID=GTM-XXXXXXX

  4. For TypeScript projects, add to env.d.ts:
     interface Env extends HydrogenEnv {
       GTM_CONTAINER_ID?: `GTM-${string}`;
       GTM_ID?: `GTM-${string}`;
     }

  5. Test your implementation:
     npm run dev

  Visit your site and check the Network tab to verify GTM is loading via the web worker.
