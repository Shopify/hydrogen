+## Partytown + Google Tag Manager Setup
+
+### Key files
+
+| File | Description |
+| --- | --- |
+| [`app/components/PartytownGoogleTagManager.tsx`](app/components/PartytownGoogleTagManager.tsx) | Component that loads GTM in a web worker via Partytown |
+| [`app/utils/partytown/maybeProxyRequest.ts`](app/utils/partytown/maybeProxyRequest.ts) | URL resolver for controlling which scripts should be reverse-proxied |
+| [`app/utils/partytown/partytownAtomicHeaders.ts`](app/utils/partytown/partytownAtomicHeaders.ts) | Headers utility for enabling Atomics mode |
+| [`app/routes/reverse-proxy.ts`](app/routes/reverse-proxy.ts) | Reverse proxy route for scripts requiring CORS headers |
+| [`app/root.tsx`](app/root.tsx) | Root layout with Partytown and GTM implementation |
+| [`app/entry.server.tsx`](app/entry.server.tsx) | Enhanced CSP configuration for GTM domains |
+
+### Configuration
+
+1. **Copy Partytown library files** (required for production):
+   ```bash
+   npm run partytown
+   ```
+
+2. **Set environment variables** in your `.env` file:
+   ```bash
+   GTM_CONTAINER_ID=GTM-XXXXXXX  # Your Google Tag Manager container ID
+   # OR
+   GTM_ID=GTM-XXXXXXX
+   ```
+
+3. **TypeScript users**: Add the environment variable to your type definitions in `app/env.d.ts`:
+   ```typescript
+   interface Env extends HydrogenEnv {
+     GTM_CONTAINER_ID?: `GTM-${string}`;
+     GTM_ID?: `GTM-${string}`;
+   }
+   ```
+
+### How it works
+
+1. **Partytown** runs third-party scripts in a web worker, keeping the main thread free
+2. **GTM scripts** are loaded with `type="text/partytown"` to run in the worker
+3. **Reverse proxy** handles scripts that need CORS headers
+4. **CSP headers** are configured to allow GTM and Google Analytics domains
+
+### Performance benefits
+
+- Main thread remains responsive
+- Third-party scripts don't block critical rendering
+- Better Core Web Vitals scores
+- Improved user experience
+
