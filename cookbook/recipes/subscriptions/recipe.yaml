title: Subscriptions
summary: A recipe to implement subscriptions in your Hydrogen storefront.
image: null
description: |
  This recipe adds subscription capabilities to your Hydrogen storefront by implementing [selling plan groups](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/SellingPlanGroup) and options.
  With these, your customers can choose between one-time purchases or recurring subscriptions when available.


  Implementing a subscription consists of making the following changes:


  1. Set up a Subscriptions app on your store (specific details in the steps below) and add selling plans to the desired products.
  2. Modify product detail pages to display subscription options with accurate pricing, for example by implementing a `SellingPlanSelector` component that presents the available subscription options for a product.
  3. Enhance GraphQL fragments to fetch all necessary selling plan data
  4. Display subscription details on applicable cart line items

requirements: |
  To implement subscriptions in your own store, you'll need a Subscriptions
  app installed on it.


  For the remainder of this recipe, we'll use the official Shopify
  Subscriptions app:

  1. Install the official [subscription app](https://apps.shopify.com/shopify-subscriptions) app.

  2. Use the app to create selling plans for your products

  3. Assign these selling plans to any products you want to offer as
  subscriptions

  _Our demo storefront comes pre-configured with an example subscription
  product with the handle `shopify-wax`._
