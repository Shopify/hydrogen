title: Subscriptions
summary: Add subscription-based products to your Hydrogen storefront.
description: |
  This recipe lets you sell subscription-based products on your Hydrogen storefront by implementing [selling plan groups](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/SellingPlanGroup). Your customers will be able to choose between one-time purchases or recurring subscriptions for any products with available selling plans.

  In this recipe you'll make the following changes:

  1. Set up a subscriptions app in your Shopify admin and add selling plans to any products that will be sold as subscriptions.
  2. Modify product detail pages to display subscription options with accurate pricing using the `SellingPlanSelector` component.
  3. Enhance GraphQL fragments to fetch all necessary selling plan data.
  4. Display subscription details on applicable line items in the cart.
  5. Add a **Subscriptions** page where customers can manage their subscriptions, which includes the option to cancel active subscriptions.
