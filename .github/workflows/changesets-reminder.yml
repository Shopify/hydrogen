          message: |
            We detected some changes in `packages/*/package.json` or `packages/*/src`, and there are no updates in the `.changeset`.
            If the changes are user-facing and should cause a version bump, run `pnpm run changeset add` to track your changes and include them in the next release CHANGELOG.
            If you are making simple updates to examples or documentation, you do not need to add a changeset.
