# Test Upgrade Flow Workflow
#
# Purpose:
# This workflow validates that the Hydrogen CLI upgrade command works correctly when
# changelog.json is modified. It ensures that users can successfully upgrade their
# Hydrogen projects to new versions without encountering dependency conflicts.
#
# What it tests:
# 1. Validates changelog.json schema and structure
# 2. Scaffolds a project simulating the previous release version
# 3. Runs the actual `hydrogen upgrade` command to the latest version
# 4. Validates all dependencies and devDependencies are upgraded correctly
# 5. Validates dependencies are removed when specified (e.g., removeDependencies)
# 6. Verifies upgrade guide markdown is generated when release has manual steps
# 7. Validates npm install succeeds without dependency conflicts
# 8. Validates the project builds successfully (skipped when manual steps are required)
#
# When it runs:
# - On push/PR when docs/changelog.json is modified
# - Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch
#
# This is critical for ensuring new changelog entries work correctly before release.
