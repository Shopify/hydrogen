# Test Upgrade Flow Workflow
#
# Purpose:
# This workflow validates that the Hydrogen CLI upgrade command works correctly when
# changelog.json is modified. It ensures that users can successfully upgrade their
# Hydrogen projects to new versions without encountering dependency conflicts or
# runtime errors.
#
# What it tests:
# 1. Dynamic version detection from local changelog.json
# 2. Scaffolds a historical Hydrogen project from git history
# 3. Runs the actual `hydrogen upgrade` command with the latest version
# 4. Validates that pnpm install succeeds without dependency conflicts
# 5. Verifies the dev server starts without import/module errors
# 6. Makes HTTP requests to ensure the app serves HTML without errors
#
# When it runs:
# - On push/PR when docs/changelog.json is modified
# - Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch
#
# Key validations:
# - No pnpm dependency resolution errors (ERESOLVE, peer deps, etc.)
# - No missing module or import errors during runtime
# - Dev server successfully serves pages
# - Build and typecheck commands succeed
#
# This is critical for ensuring new releases don't break the upgrade path for users.
