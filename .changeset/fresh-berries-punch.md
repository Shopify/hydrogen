Moved the Cursor rules into more generic LLM prompt files. If you were using the Cursor rules, you will find the prompts in the `cookbook/llms` folder and they can be put into your `.cursor/rules` folder manually. LLM prompt files will be maintained moving forward, while previous Cursor rules will not be updated anymore.
