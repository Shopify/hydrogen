- Fix an issue with our starter template where duplicate content can exist on URLs that use internationalized handles. For example, if you have a product handle in english of `the-havoc` and translate it to `das-chaos` in German, duplicate content exists at both: ([#2821](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/2821)) by [@blittle](https://github.com/blittle)

  - @shopify/mini-oxygen@3.2.1

## 10.0.0

### Patch Changes

- Add support for HTTP proxies with the environment variables `SHOPIFY_HTTP_PROXY` and `SHOPIFY_HTTPS_PROXY`. Define one of these variables before starting the Hydrogen dev server to make all requests go through a proxy server. ([#2831](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/2831)) by [@blittle](https://github.com/blittle)

  If your proxy uses authentication, provide the auth in the following format:

  ```bash
  SHOPIFY_HTTP_PROXY=http://user:pass@yourproxy.com:PORT
  ```

- Moved the `Layout` component back into `root.tsx` to avoid issues with styled errors. ([#2829](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/2829)) by [@ruggishop](https://github.com/ruggishop)

  1. If you have a separate `app/layout.tsx` file, delete it and move its default exported component into your `root.tsx`. For example:

     ```ts
     // /app/root.tsx
     export function Layout({children}: {children?: React.ReactNode}) {
       const nonce = useNonce();
       const data = useRouteLoaderData<RootLoader>('root');

       return (
         <html lang="en">
         ...
       );
     }
     ```

- Updated dependencies [[`92b3d0c4`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/92b3d0c4443363648053e720420c82a8484695cf)]:

- Updates the `@shopify/cli`, `@shopify/cli-kit` and `@shopify/plugin-cloudflare` dependencies to 3.77.1. ([#2816](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/2816)) by [@seanparsons](https://github.com/seanparsons)

## 9.0.9

### Patch Changes

- Updates `@shopify/cli-kit`, `@shopify/cli` and `@shopify/plugin-cloudflare` to `3.77.0`. ([#2810](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/2810)) by [@seanparsons](https://github.com/seanparsons)

- Support for the Remix future flag `v3_routeConfig`. ([#2722](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/2722)) by [@seanparsons](https://github.com/seanparsons)

  Please refer to the Remix documentation for more details on `v3_routeConfig` future flag: [https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/future-flags#v3_routeconfig](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/future-flags#v3_routeconfig)

  1. Add the following npm package dev dependencies:

     ```diff
       "devDependencies": {
         "@remix-run/dev": "^2.16.1",
     +    "@remix-run/fs-routes": "^2.16.1",
     +    "@remix-run/route-config": "^2.16.1",
     ```

  1. If you have `export function Layout` in your `root.tsx`, move this export into its own file. For example:

     ```ts
     // /app/layout.tsx
     export default function Layout() {
       const nonce = useNonce();
       const data = useRouteLoaderData<RootLoader>('root');

       return (
         <html lang="en">
         ...
       );
     }
     ```

  1. Create a `routes.ts` file.

     ```ts
     import {flatRoutes} from '@remix-run/fs-routes';
     import {layout, type RouteConfig} from '@remix-run/route-config';
     import {hydrogenRoutes} from '@shopify/hydrogen';

     export default hydrogenRoutes([
       // Your entire app reading from routes folder using Layout from layout.tsx
       layout('./layout.tsx', await flatRoutes()),
     ]) satisfies RouteConfig;
     ```

  1. Update your `vite.config.ts`.

     ```diff
     export default defineConfig({
       plugins: [
         hydrogen(),
         oxygen(),
         remix({
     -      presets: [hydrogen.preset()],
     +      presets: [hydrogen.v3preset()],
     ```

  It is recommended to delete client sourcemaps before deploying the app to production.

## 8.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Clean up messaging around unlinked storefronts when running CLI commands ([#1937](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1937)) by [@aswamy](https://github.com/aswamy)

  - When you run `env list`, `env pull`, or `deploy` against a storefront that isn't linked, it will show a warning message instead of an error message.
  - If you don't have a storefront to link to on Admin, we will just ask you to create a storefront instead of displaying an option list of size 1.
  - If you deleted a storefront on Admin, we will try to relink your storefront when running `env list`, `env pull`, or `deploy`.

- Add `@return` JSDoc tag to functions in JavaScript projects. ([#2014](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/2014)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Fix `--quickstart` flag to support overwritting it with other flags. Example: `h2 init --quickstart --no-install-deps`. ([#2023](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/2023)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  Show error in `h2 debug cpu` command for Vite projects until we support it.

  Remove deprecated `--styling` flag from the `h2 init` command.

- Fix a warning when combining mock.shop and customer-account-push ([#1992](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1992)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  - @shopify/mini-oxygen@3.0.1

## 8.0.0

### Major Changes

- Hydrogen CLI now requires `@shopify/mini-oxygen` to be installed separately as a dev dependency. It is still used automatically under the hood so there is no need to change your application code aside from installing the dependency. ([#1891](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1891)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  Also, if a port provided via `--port` or `--inspector-port` flags is already in use, the CLI will now exit with an error message instead of finding a new open port. When the flags are not provided, the CLI will still find an open port.

### Minor Changes

- Move the Hydrogen CLI's `env push` command to stable. ([#1946](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1946)) by [@aswamy](https://github.com/aswamy)

- Deprecate the `--env-branch` flag, in favor of `--env`. ([#1841](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1841)) by [@aswamy](https://github.com/aswamy)

  - `--env` accepts the environment's handle, instead of the environment's associated branch name
    - Run `env list` to display all environments and their handles
  - Any CLI commands that accepted the `--env-branch` flag now accept the `--env` flag.

- Support scaffolding projects from external repositories using the `--template` flag. ([#1867](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1867)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  The following examples are equivalent:

  ```sh
  npm create @shopify/hydrogen -- --template shopify/hydrogen-demo-store
  npm create @shopify/hydrogen -- --template github.com/shopify/hydrogen-demo-store
  npm create @shopify/hydrogen -- --template https://github.com/shopify/hydrogen-demo-store
  ```

- Add the `customer-account push` command to the Hydrogen CLI. This allows you to push the current `--dev-origin` URL to the Shopify admin to enable secure connection to the Customer Account API for local development. ([#1804](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1804)) by [@michenly](https://github.com/michenly)

- Remove the `@shopify/cli-hydrogen/experimental-vite` import path in favor of `@shopify/hydrogen/vite` and `@shopify/mini-oxygen/vite`. ([#1935](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1935)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

### Patch Changes

- Avoid throwing error in `h2 dev --codegen` when the Customer Account schema is not found. ([#1962](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1962)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Bump internal workerd dependency to fix a bug when running on Node 21. ([#1866](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1866)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Support Node's `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` [environment variables](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#environment-variables) in the worker environment. ([#1882](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1882)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  Use this at your own risk to disable certificate validation or provide additional CA certificates when making HTTPS requests from the worker:

  ```sh
  # Disable certificate validation
  NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 npm run dev

  # Provide additional CA certificates
  NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/usr/.../ca-certificates/my-file.crt npm run dev
  ```

- Add `--quickstart` flag option to init/create command. ([#1822](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1822)) by [@gfscott](https://github.com/gfscott)

- Add a newline after the `h2` alias created in ZSH/Bash profiles. ([#1950](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1950)) by [@madmath](https://github.com/madmath)

- Fix the `--markets` flag when using `npm create @shopify/hydrogen`. ([#1916](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1916)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Handle duplicate storefront names when running `link` command. ([#1860](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1860)) by [@gfscott](https://github.com/gfscott)

- List uncommitted files in the `deploy` command's "uncommitted changes" error message. ([#1944](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1944)) by [@graygilmore](https://github.com/graygilmore)

- Improve `h2 setup vite` command to cover more migration steps (e.g. vanilla-extract, css-modules, etc.) and keep Remix future flags. ([#1915](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1915)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Add `--verbose` flag to `h2 dev` and `h2 preview` commands to enable verbose logging. ([#1928](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1928)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  Only CLI logs become verbose by default. If you also want to see verbose logs from Vite as well, use `DEBUG=* h2 dev` instead.

- Updated dependencies [[`646b78d4`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/646b78d4bc26310121b16000ed4d1c5d5e63957d), [`140e4768`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/140e4768c880aaed4ba95b1d4c707df6963e011c), [`ebaf5529`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/ebaf5529287b24a70b3146444b18f95b64f9f336)]:
  - @shopify/hydrogen-codegen@0.3.0
  - @shopify/mini-oxygen@3.0.0

## 7.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Change the required Vite version to `~5.1.0` instead of `^5.1.0` to avoid breaking changes in experimental APIs that will be introduced in Vite 5.2.0. ([#1830](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1830)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

## 7.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Update `@shopify/cli-kit` dependency to `3.56.3` and improve some help messaging. ([#1786](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1786)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Hide a non-actionable warning about a deprecated Node.js module `punycode`. ([#1801](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1801)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Add experimental support for Vite projects. ([#1728](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1728)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  To test this unstable feature, make sure you're running the latest version of the Hydrogen CLI, then run `npx shopify hydrogen setup vite` in your Hydrogen project. This command edits existing files and creates some new ones required to run Vite.

  Please report [any issues you run into](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%3Aunverified&projects=&template=bug_report.yml), and let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions.

- Fix an issue that could cause the local worker runtime to freeze. ([#1819](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1819)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Updated dependencies [[`4e3d5b00`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/4e3d5b005941db9a6d8eb2a5d7edf23148d60b07)]:
  - @shopify/hydrogen-codegen@0.2.2

## 7.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Adds new command line flag options for the `deploy` command: ([#1736](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1736)) by [@vincentezw](https://github.com/vincentezw)

  - `build-command`: Allows users to specify which command is used to build the project (instead of the default build function). This provides more flexibility for projects that have custom build processes.
  - `no-lockfile-check`: Allows users to skip the lockfile check during the build process. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to bypass the lockfile check for certain reasons, such as in monorepos, where the lockfile resides in the root folder.

- Adding skip-verification flag to hydrogen deploy command ([#1770](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1770)) by [@lynchv](https://github.com/lynchv)

### Patch Changes

- Add `--env-file` flag to the `deploy` command ([#1743](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1743)) by [@aswamy](https://github.com/aswamy)

  Optionally provide the path to a local .env file to override the environment variables set on Admin.

- This is an important fix to a bug with 404 routes and path-based i18n projects where some unknown routes would not properly render a 404. This fixes all new projects, but to fix existing projects, add a `($locale).tsx` route with the following contents: ([#1732](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1732)) by [@blittle](https://github.com/blittle)

  ```ts
  import {type LoaderFunctionArgs} from '@remix-run/server-runtime';

  export async function loader({params, context}: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
    const {language, country} = context.storefront.i18n;

    if (
      params.locale &&
      params.locale.toLowerCase() !== `${language}-${country}`.toLowerCase()
    ) {
      // If the locale URL param is defined, yet we still are still at the default locale
      // then the the locale param must be invalid, send to the 404 page
      throw new Response(null, {status: 404});
    }

    return null;
  }
  ```

- Non-zero exit codes are now honored ([#1766](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1766)) by [@graygilmore](https://github.com/graygilmore)

## 7.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Add support for multiple schemas in GraphiQL. Fix links in Subrequest Profiler. ([#1693](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1693)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- ♻️ `CustomerClient` type is deprecated and replaced by `CustomerAccount` ([#1692](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1692)) by [@michenly](https://github.com/michenly)

- Skip prompt about creating `h2` shortcut during init flow if it has been already added to the environment. ([#1718](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1718)) by [@gfscott](https://github.com/gfscott)

- Bump Codegen dependencies to fix known bugs and remove patches. ([#1705](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1705)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Fix local asset path to Oxygen to return valid preflight headers ([#1709](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1709)) by [@wizardlyhel](https://github.com/wizardlyhel)

- Updated dependencies [[`c7b2017f`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/c7b2017f11a2cb4d280dfd8f170e65a908b9ea02)]:
  - @shopify/hydrogen-codegen@0.2.1

## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- Make the worker runtime the default for the local development server when running `dev` and `preview`. To access the legacy Node.js runtime, pass the `--legacy-runtime` flag. The legacy runtime will be deprecated and removed in a future release. ([#1625](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1625)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Remove deprecated `build` command flags `--base`, `--entry`, `--target`. Additionally, `--codegen-unstable` is now `--codegen`. ([#1640](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1640)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

### Minor Changes

- Check for local project GraphQL config files (example: `.graphqlrc.yml`) when running in Codegen mode ([#1577](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1577)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Add `deploy` command to Hydrogen CLI ([#1628](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1628)) by [@graygilmore](https://github.com/graygilmore)

  You can now deploy your Hydrogen app without connecting to GitHub. Run the `deploy` command from your local terminal or configure your own CI/CD workflows from any platform.

  Run `npx shopify hydrogen deploy --help` for more details.

- Add `--diff` flag to `dev` and `build` commands, used for building Hydrogen app examples. ([#1549](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1549)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Add `--template` flag to enable scaffolding projects based on [examples](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/tree/main/examples) from the Hydrogen repo. ([#1608](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1608)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  Example: `npm create @shopify/hydrogen@latest -- --template multipass`.

### Patch Changes

- Reorganize starter template file and folder structure ([#1612](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1612)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Generate sourcemaps by default when running the `deploy` command ([#1623](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1623)) by [@blittle](https://github.com/blittle)

- Remove bundle-size check from the `build` command, in favor of checking server-side with `deploy` ([#1614](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1614)) by [@benwolfram](https://github.com/benwolfram)

- - Update example and template Remix versions to `^2.5.1` ([#1639](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1639)) by [@wizardlyhel](https://github.com/wizardlyhel)

  - Enable Remix future flags:
    - [`v3_fetcherPersist`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-fetchers#additional-resources)
    - [`v3_relativeSplatpath`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-resolved-path#splat-paths)

- Add the option to create a new storefront when running the `init` command ([#1681](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1681)) by [@aswamy](https://github.com/aswamy)

- Updated dependencies [[`0241b7d2`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/0241b7d2dcb887d259ce9033aca356d391bc07df), [`9ad7c5ef`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/9ad7c5efee8bff63760b36a1a7c194f6bb8e07e5)]:
  - @shopify/mini-oxygen@2.2.5
  - @shopify/hydrogen-codegen@0.2.0

## 6.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Add the [`upgrade` command](https://h2o.fyi/cli#upgrade) to make it easier to upgrade from older versions of Hydrogen. Features: ([#1458](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1458)) by [@juanpprieto](https://github.com/juanpprieto)

  - Automatically updates dependencies in your package.json file.
  - Generates a customized instruction file in the `/.shopify` directory, outlining any code changes required to complete the upgrade.
  - Adds a warning when running the `dev` command with an outdated version.
  - Defaults to the latest version. Pass a `--version` flag and a version number to select a specific one.

  To get started, run `npx shopify hydrogen upgrade` in your Hydrogen project.

- The worker runtime for development is now stable. This makes your development environment closer to parity with Oxygen’s production runtime. Pass the `--worker` flag with the `dev` or `preview` commands to enable it. This runtime will be enabled by default in the next major release. ([#1525](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1525)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Add the `--debug` flag to the [`dev` command](https://h2o.fyi/cli#dev) to enable step debugging in browser dev tools. ([#1480](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1480)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  To enable debugger connections for the Hydrogen app worker file, run `npx shopify hydrogen dev --debug --worker`, then open [localhost:9229](http://localhost:9229) in your browser.

### Patch Changes

- Sync up environment variable names across all example & type files. ([#1542](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1542)) by [@michenly](https://github.com/michenly)

- Serve assets from a separate domain when running the dev server, to better simulate cross-domain behaviors. This makes it more realistic to work with CORS requests, content security policies, and CDN paths in development. ([#1503](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1503)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Update all Node.js dependencies to version 18. (Not a breaking change, since Node.js 18 is already required by Remix v2.) ([#1543](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1543)) by [@michenly](https://github.com/michenly)

- 🐛 fix undefined menu error ([#1533](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1533)) by [@michenly](https://github.com/michenly)

- Fix how peer dependencies are resolved. ([#1489](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1489)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Update Shopify CLI versions. ([#1504](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1504)) by [@vincentezw](https://github.com/vincentezw)

- Updated dependencies [[`848c6260`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/848c6260a2db3a9cb0c86351f0f7128f61e028f0), [`8fce70de`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/8fce70de32bd61ee86a6d895ac43cc1f78f1bf49)]:

## 6.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix Shopify login during the init flow where the process would just exit when awaiting for a keypress. ([#1481](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1481)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Updated dependencies [[`074ef6e8`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/074ef6e88412dc4f731c253f1dcd27cb73afcc3c)]:
  - @shopify/hydrogen@2023.10.1

## 6.0.0

### Minor Changes

- The Codegen feature is now considered stable and related dependencies have been updated. Use `--codegen` flag instead of `--codegen-unstable` to generate code from your GraphQL queries. ([#1108](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1108)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

### Patch Changes

- Updated internal dependencies to improve terminal output. ([#1456](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1456)) by [@vincentezw](https://github.com/vincentezw)

  Please update the `@shopify/cli` dependency in your app to avoid duplicated subdependencies:

  ```diff
    "dependencies": {
  -   "@shopify/cli": "3.49.2",
  +   "@shopify/cli": "3.50.0",
    }
  ```

- Updated dependencies [[`3eb376fe`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/3eb376fe8796b50131dc43845772ae555e07a1a6)]:
  - @shopify/hydrogen-react@2023.7.6

## 5.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Generated JavaScript projects now use Codegen and JSDoc to enhance editor autocompletion. ([#1334](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1334)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- We've added an experimental tool for profiling the CPU at startup. This is useful for debugging slow startup times when Oxygen deployments fail with related errors. ([#1352](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1352)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  Run the new `h2 debug cpu` command to build + watch your app and generate a `startup.cpuprofile` file that you can open in DevTools or VSCode to see a flamegraph of CPU usage.

### Patch Changes

- Integrate the debug-network tooling with the new `--worker-unstable` runtime CLI flag. ([#1387](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1387)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Updated dependencies [[`d30e2651`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/d30e265180e7856d2257d8cad0bd067c8a91e9cc), [`b81b452d`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/b81b452d010c650b1de1678f729945d1d4394820), [`1b45311d`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/1b45311d28b2ca941c479a1896efa89a9b71bec1), [`2627faa7`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/2627faa7f09ba306506bb206d4d6624de5691961)]:
  - @shopify/hydrogen-react@2023.7.5
  - @shopify/remix-oxygen@1.1.8

## 5.4.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix subrequest performance in development. ([#1411](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1411)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Increase the request body size limit to 100mb when running locally. ([#1421](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1421)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Updated dependencies [[`29414664`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/294146644df57592a775ae33cdf4359015155d72), [`832a0eaf`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/832a0eafad331f61b7cfdf90dec6427f1aaaef6b)]:

- Updated dependencies [[`4f735fd7`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/4f735fd725aef26cd3bd5b50c87d2c028b93c598)]:
  - @shopify/remix-oxygen@1.1.6

## 5.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Add token flag, environmentTag flag, environment selection screen, rename health check to deployment verification ([#1381](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1381)) by [@vincentezw](https://github.com/vincentezw)

- Updated dependencies [[`eb9451ed`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/eb9451ed7883f610d1412bdab2553523859ac701)]:
  - @shopify/remix-oxygen@1.1.5

## 5.4.0

### Minor Changes

- The build command now throws errors on CI when it can't find a valid lockfile. This should prevent unforseen issues related to dependency versioning in production. ([#1370](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1370)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  This behavior can be disabled with the flag `--no-lockfile-check`, which might be useful in monorepos or other setups where the lockfile is not available in the project directory.

### Patch Changes

- Add check to render collection images when available ([#1373](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1373)) by [@juanpprieto](https://github.com/juanpprieto)

- Remove sourcemap annotations from client bundles. This prevents errors showing up in the devtools when the sourcemaps fail to load. ([#1364](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1364)) by [@blittle](https://github.com/blittle)

## 5.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Make the CLI bundle analysis compatible with older Remix versions that don't output a metafile ([#1357](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1357)) by [@blittle](https://github.com/blittle)

## 5.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `--worker-unstable` flag to `h2 dev` and `h2 preview` commands. This flag enables the use of the new experimental worker runtime for local development, which is closer to Oxygen production than the current Node.js sandbox. Please report any issues you encounter with this flag. ([#1184](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1184)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Add deploy command (disabled by default) ([#1019](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1019)) by [@vincentezw](https://github.com/vincentezw)

### Patch Changes

- Add magic cart and discount routes to skeleton template ([#1309](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1309)) by [@juanpprieto](https://github.com/juanpprieto)

- Updates placeholder page to suggest the `h2 setup` command, instead of `h2 generate route home` ([#1347](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1347)) by [@benjaminsehl](https://github.com/benjaminsehl)

- Adjust behavior of `h2 preview` command around environment variables to be more consistent with `h2 dev` command. ([#1184](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1184)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- We've added a tool for analyzing bundle sizes. You should try to keep your worker bundle small. The larger it gets effects the cold startup time of your app. We now include `client-bundle-analyzer.html` and `worker-bundle-analyzer.html` files in the build output. Open these in your browser to view an interactive analysis of your bundles. The CLI output also includes links to each file. Hydrogen also fails to build if your bundle size is over 10 MB. This is because Oxygen only supports worker bundles less than 10 MB. ([#1306](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1306)) by [@blittle](https://github.com/blittle)

- Raise the subrequest limit to 100 for development. ([#1348](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1348)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Fix `--routes` and `--markets` flag when creating new projects. ([#1342](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1342)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Make sourcemaps to default be turned on. They were off to prevent sourcemaps leaking server code to the client. Oxygen now makes sure to not serve the sourcemaps, so it's okay to generate them. Also, when sourcemaps are present, we hope to enable sourcemapped stack traces in error logs on Oxygen.

### Patch Changes

- Delay installing certain dependencies to speed up project initialization time. ([#1272](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1272)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- (Unstable) server-side network request debug virtual route ([#1284](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1284)) by [@wizardlyhel](https://github.com/wizardlyhel)

  1. Update your `server.ts` so that it also passes in the `waitUntil` and `env`.

     ```diff
       const handleRequest = createRequestHandler({
         build: remixBuild,
         mode: process.env.NODE_ENV,
     +    getLoadContext: () => ({session, storefront, env, waitUntil}),
       });
     ```

     If you are using typescript, make sure to update `remix.env.d.ts`

     ```diff
       declare module '@shopify/remix-oxygen' {
         export interface AppLoadContext {
     +     env: Env;
           cart: HydrogenCart;
           storefront: Storefront;
           session: HydrogenSession;
     +      waitUntil: ExecutionContext['waitUntil'];
         }
       }
     ```

  2. Run `npm run dev` and you should see terminal log information about a new virtual route that you can view server-side network requests at http://localhost:3000/debug-network

  3. Open http://localhost:3000/debug-network in a tab and your app another tab. When you navigate around your app, you should see server network requests being logged in the debug-network tab

### Patch Changes

- Fix the default page shown when the project has no routes. ([#1266](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1266)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Hydrogen is now compatible with TypeScript v5. ([#1240](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1240)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  If you have `typescript` as a dev dependency in your app, it is recommended to change its version as follows:

  ```diff
    "devDependencies": {
      ...
  -   "typescript": "^4.9.5",
  +   "typescript": "^5.2.2",
    },
  ```

  After installing the new version of TypeScript, you may need to update the version used in your IDE. For example, in VSCode, you can do this by clicking on the `{ }` icon in the bottom-right toolbar next to the language mode (generally, `{ } TypeScript JSX` when editing a `.tsx` file).

- Fix development server port in some situations where it was set to a random number instead of the default 3000 or the `--port` flag value. ([#1267](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1267)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Fix transpiling TS to JS when scaffolding routes. ([#1273](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1273)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

    // ...
  }
  ```

  3. Add Remix' `<LiveReload />` component if you don't have it to your `root.jsx` or `root.tsx` file:

  ```diff
  import {
    Outlet,
    Scripts,
  + LiveReload,
    ScrollRestoration,
  } from '@remix-run/react';

  // ...

  export default function App() {
    // ...

    return (
      <html>
        <head>
         {/* ...  */}
        </head>
        <body>
          <Outlet />
          <ScrollRestoration />
          <Scripts />
  +       <LiveReload />
        </body>
      </html>
    );
  }

  export function ErrorBoundary() {
    // ...

    return (
      <html>
        <head>
          {/* ... */}
        </head>
        <body>
          Error!
          <Scripts />

  - @shopify/remix-oxygen@1.0.7

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add **UNSTABLE** support for GraphQL Codegen to automatically generate types for every Storefront API query in the project via `@shopify/hydrogen-codegen`. ([#707](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/707)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  > Note: This feature is unstable and subject to change in patch releases.

  How to use it while unstable:

  1. Write your queries/mutations in `.ts` or `.tsx` files and use the `#graphql` comment inside the strings. It's important that every query/mutation/fragment in your project has a **unique name**:

     ```ts
     const UNIQUE_NAME_SHOP_QUERY = `#graphql
       query unique_name_shop { shop { id } }
     `;
     ```

     If you use string interpolation in your query variables (e.g. for reusing fragments) you will need to specify `as const` after each interpolated template literal. This helps TypeScript infer the types properly instead of getting a generic `string` type:

     ```ts
     const UNIQUE_NAME_SHOP_FRAGMENT = `#graphql
       fragment unique_name_shop_fields on Shop { id name }
     `;

     const UNIQUE_NAME_SHOP_QUERY = `#graphql
       query unique_name_shop { shop { ...unique_name_shop_fields } }
       ${UNIQUE_NAME_SHOP_FRAGMENT}
     ` as const;
     ```

  2. Pass the queries to the Storefront client and do not specify a generic type value:

     ```diff
     -import type {Shop} from '@shopify/hydrogen/storefront-api-types';
     // ...
     -const result = await storefront.query<{shop: Shop}>(UNIQUE_NAME_SHOP_QUERY);
     +const result = await storefront.query(UNIQUE_NAME_SHOP_QUERY);
     ```

  3. Pass the flag `--codegen-unstable` when running the development server, or use the new `codegen-unstable` command to run it standalone without a dev-server:

     ```bash
     npx shopify hydrogen dev --codegen-unstable # Dev server + codegen watcher
     npx shopify hydrogen codegen-unstable # One-off codegen
     npx shopify hydrogen codegen-unstable --watch # Standalone codegen watcher
     ```

  As a result, a new `storefrontapi.generated.d.ts` file should be generated at your project root. You don't need to reference this file from anywhere for it to work, but you should commit it every time the types change.

  **Optional**: you can tune the codegen configuration by providing a `<root>/codegen.ts` file (or specify a different path with the `--codegen-config-path` flag) with the following content:

  ```ts
  import type {CodegenConfig} from '@graphql-codegen/cli';
  import {preset, pluckConfig, schema} from '@shopify/hydrogen-codegen';

  export default <CodegenConfig>{
    overwrite: true,
    pluckConfig,
    generates: {
      ['storefrontapi.generated.d.ts']: {
        preset,
        schema,
        documents: ['*.{ts,tsx}', 'app/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  Feel free to add your custom schemas and generation config here or read from different document files. Please, report any issue you find in our repository.

  - @shopify/hydrogen-react@2023.4.0

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Updated CLI prompts. It's recommended to update your version of `@shopify/cli` to `3.45.0` when updating `@shopify/cli-hydrogen`. ([#733](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/733)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  ```diff
  "dependencies": {
  -  "@shopify/cli": "3.x.x",
  +  "@shopify/cli": "3.45.0",
  }
  ```

- Added a new `shortcut` command that creates a global `h2` alias for the Hydrogen CLI: ([#679](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/679)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  ```sh
  $> npx shopify hydrogen shortcut
  ```

  After that, you can run commands using the new alias:

  ```sh
  $> h2 generate route home
  $> h2 g r home # Same as the above
  $> h2 check routes
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Add support for the Remix future flags `v2_meta`, `v2_errorBoundary` and `v2_routeConvention` to the `generate` command. If these flags are enabled in your project, the new generated files will follow the v2 conventions. ([#756](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/756)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)
