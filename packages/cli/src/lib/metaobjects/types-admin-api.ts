 * > [See below for more details on the lifecycle of a fulfillment order](#the-lifecycle-of-a-fulfillment-order).
 *
 * ## Retrieving fulfillment orders
 *
 * ### Fulfillment orders from an order
 *
 * All fulfillment orders related to a given order can be retrieved with the
 * [Order.fulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#connection-order-fulfillmentorders)
 * connection.
 *
 * [API access scopes](#api-access-scopes)
 * govern which fulfillments orders are returned to clients.
 * An API client will only receive a subset of the fulfillment orders which belong to an order
 * if they don't have the necessary access scopes to view all of the fulfillment orders.
 *
 * ### Fulfillment orders assigned to the app for fulfillment
 *
 * Fulfillment service apps can retrieve the fulfillment orders which have been assigned to their locations with the
 * [Shop.assignedFulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Shop#connection-shop-assignedfulfillmentorders)
 * connection.
 * Use the `assignmentStatus` argument to control whether all assigned fulfillment orders
 * should be returned or only those where a merchant has sent a
 * [fulfillment request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrderMerchantRequest)
 * and it has yet to be responded to.
 *
 * The API client must be granted the `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope to access
 * the assigned fulfillment orders.
 *
 * ### All fulfillment orders
 *
 * Apps can retrieve all fulfillment orders with the
 * [fulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/fulfillmentOrders)
 * query. This query returns all assigned, merchant-managed, and third-party fulfillment orders on the shop,
 * which are accessible to the app according to the
 * [fulfillment order access scopes](#api-access-scopes) it was granted with.
 *
 * ## The lifecycle of a fulfillment order
 *
 * ### Fulfillment Order Creation
 *
 * After an order is created, a background worker performs the order routing process which determines
 * which locations will be responsible for fulfilling the purchased items.
 * Once the order routing process is complete, one or more fulfillment orders will be created
 * and assigned to these locations. It is not possible to manually create fulfillment orders.
 *
 * Once a fulfillment order has been created, it will have one of two different lifecycles depending on
 * the type of location which the fulfillment order is assigned to.
 *
 * ### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a merchant managed location
 *
 * Fulfillment orders are completed by creating
 * [fulfillments](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment).
 * Fulfillments represents the work done.
 *
 * For digital products a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfilment once the digital asset
 * has been provisioned.
 * For example, in the case of a digital gift card, a merchant would to do this once
 * the gift card has been activated - before the email has been shipped.
 *
 * On the other hand, for a traditional shipped order,
 * a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfillment after picking and packing the items relating
 * to a fulfillment order, but before the courier has collected the goods.
 *
 * [Learn about managing fulfillment orders as an order management app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/order-management-apps/manage-fulfillments).
 *
 * ### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a location which is managed by a fulfillment service
 *
 * For fulfillment orders which are assigned to a location that is managed by a fulfillment service,
 * a merchant or an Order Management App can
 * [send a fulfillment request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitFulfillmentRequest)
 * to the fulfillment service which operates the location to request that they fulfill the associated items.
 * A fulfillment service has the option to
 * [accept](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderAcceptFulfillmentRequest)
 * or [reject](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderRejectFulfillmentRequest)
 * this fulfillment request.
 *
 * Once the fulfillment service has accepted the request, the request can no longer be cancelled by the merchant
 * or order management app and instead a
 * [cancellation request must be submitted](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitCancellationRequest)
 * to the fulfillment service.
 *
 * Once a fulfillment service accepts a fulfillment request,
 * then after they are ready to pack items and send them for delivery, they create fulfillments with the
 * [fulfillmentCreateV2](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentCreateV2)
 * mutation.
 * They can provide tracking information right away or create fulfillments without it and then
 * update the tracking information for fulfillments with the
 * [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdateV2](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdateV2)
 * mutation.
 *
 * [Learn about managing fulfillment orders as a fulfillment service](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments).
 *
 * ## API access scopes
 *
 * Fulfillment orders are governed by the following API access scopes:
 *
 * * The `read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and
 *   `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes
 *   grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations.
 * * The `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` and `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders`
 *   access scopes are intended for fulfillment services.
 *   These scopes grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to locations that are being managed
 *   by fulfillment services.
 * * The `read_third_party_fulfillment_orders` and `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
 *   access scopes grant access to fulfillment orders
 *   assigned to locations managed by other fulfillment services.
 *
 * ### Fulfillment service app access scopes
 *
 * Usually, **fulfillment services** have the `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope
 * and don't have the `*_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
 * or `*_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes.
 * The app will only have access to the fulfillment orders assigned to their location
 * (or multiple locations if the app registers multiple fulfillment services on the shop).
 * The app will not have access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations
 * or locations owned by other fulfillment service apps.
 *
 * ### Order management app access scopes
 *
 * **Order management apps** will usually request `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and
 * `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders` access scopes. This will allow them to manage all fulfillment orders
 * on behalf of a merchant.
 *
 * If an app combines the functions of an order management app and a fulfillment service,
 * then the app should request all
 * access scopes to manage all assigned and all unassigned fulfillment orders.
 *
 * ## Notifications about fulfillment orders
 *
 * Fulfillment services are required to
 * [register](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentService)
 * a self-hosted callback URL which has a number of uses. One of these uses is that this callback URL will be notified
 * whenever a merchant submits a fulfillment or cancellation request.
 *
 * Both merchants and apps can
 * [subscribe](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks)
 * to the
 * [fulfillment order webhooks](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/WebhookSubscriptionTopic#value-fulfillmentorderscancellationrequestaccepted)
 * to be notified whenever fulfillment order related domain events occur.
 *
 * [Learn about fulfillment workflows](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment).

 *
 * ## Retrieving fulfillment orders
 *
 * ### Fulfillment orders from an order
 *
 * All fulfillment orders related to a given order can be retrieved with the
 * [Order.fulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#connection-order-fulfillmentorders)
 * connection.
 *
 * [API access scopes](#api-access-scopes)
 * govern which fulfillments orders are returned to clients.
 * An API client will only receive a subset of the fulfillment orders which belong to an order
 * if they don't have the necessary access scopes to view all of the fulfillment orders.
 *
 * ### Fulfillment orders assigned to the app for fulfillment
 *
 * Fulfillment service apps can retrieve the fulfillment orders which have been assigned to their locations with the
 * [Shop.assignedFulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Shop#connection-shop-assignedfulfillmentorders)
 * connection.
 * Use the `assignmentStatus` argument to control whether all assigned fulfillment orders
 * should be returned or only those where a merchant has sent a
 * [fulfillment request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrderMerchantRequest)
 * and it has yet to be responded to.
 *
 * The API client must be granted the `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope to access
 * the assigned fulfillment orders.
 *
 * ### All fulfillment orders
 *
 * Apps can retrieve all fulfillment orders with the
 * [fulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/fulfillmentOrders)
 * query. This query returns all assigned, merchant-managed, and third-party fulfillment orders on the shop,
 * which are accessible to the app according to the
 * [fulfillment order access scopes](#api-access-scopes) it was granted with.
 *
 * ## The lifecycle of a fulfillment order
 *
 * ### Fulfillment Order Creation
 *
 * After an order is created, a background worker performs the order routing process which determines
 * which locations will be responsible for fulfilling the purchased items.
 * Once the order routing process is complete, one or more fulfillment orders will be created
 * and assigned to these locations. It is not possible to manually create fulfillment orders.
 *
 * Once a fulfillment order has been created, it will have one of two different lifecycles depending on
 * the type of location which the fulfillment order is assigned to.
 *
 * ### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a merchant managed location
 *
 * Fulfillment orders are completed by creating
 * [fulfillments](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment).
 * Fulfillments represents the work done.
 *
 * For digital products a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfilment once the digital asset
 * has been provisioned.
 * For example, in the case of a digital gift card, a merchant would to do this once
 * the gift card has been activated - before the email has been shipped.
 *
 * On the other hand, for a traditional shipped order,
 * a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfillment after picking and packing the items relating
 * to a fulfillment order, but before the courier has collected the goods.
 *
 * [Learn about managing fulfillment orders as an order management app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/order-management-apps/manage-fulfillments).
 *
 * ### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a location which is managed by a fulfillment service
 *
 * For fulfillment orders which are assigned to a location that is managed by a fulfillment service,
 * a merchant or an Order Management App can
 * [send a fulfillment request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitFulfillmentRequest)
 * to the fulfillment service which operates the location to request that they fulfill the associated items.
 * A fulfillment service has the option to
 * [accept](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderAcceptFulfillmentRequest)
 * or [reject](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderRejectFulfillmentRequest)
 * this fulfillment request.
 *
 * Once the fulfillment service has accepted the request, the request can no longer be cancelled by the merchant
 * or order management app and instead a
 * [cancellation request must be submitted](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitCancellationRequest)
 * to the fulfillment service.
 *
 * Once a fulfillment service accepts a fulfillment request,
 * then after they are ready to pack items and send them for delivery, they create fulfillments with the
 * [fulfillmentCreateV2](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentCreateV2)
 * mutation.
 * They can provide tracking information right away or create fulfillments without it and then
 * update the tracking information for fulfillments with the
 * [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdateV2](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdateV2)
 * mutation.
 *
 * [Learn about managing fulfillment orders as a fulfillment service](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments).
 *
 * ## API access scopes
 *
 * Fulfillment orders are governed by the following API access scopes:
 *
 * * The `read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and
 *   `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes
 *   grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations.
 * * The `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` and `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders`
 *   access scopes are intended for fulfillment services.
 *   These scopes grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to locations that are being managed
 *   by fulfillment services.
 * * The `read_third_party_fulfillment_orders` and `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
 *   access scopes grant access to fulfillment orders
 *   assigned to locations managed by other fulfillment services.
 *
 * ### Fulfillment service app access scopes
 *
 * Usually, **fulfillment services** have the `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope
 * and don't have the `*_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
 * or `*_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes.
 * The app will only have access to the fulfillment orders assigned to their location
 * (or multiple locations if the app registers multiple fulfillment services on the shop).
 * The app will not have access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations
 * or locations owned by other fulfillment service apps.
 *
 * ### Order management app access scopes
 *
 * **Order management apps** will usually request `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and
 * `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders` access scopes. This will allow them to manage all fulfillment orders
 * on behalf of a merchant.
 *
 * If an app combines the functions of an order management app and a fulfillment service,
 * then the app should request all
 * access scopes to manage all assigned and all unassigned fulfillment orders.
 *
 * ## Notifications about fulfillment orders
 *
 * Fulfillment services are required to
 * [register](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentService)
 * a self-hosted callback URL which has a number of uses. One of these uses is that this callback URL will be notified
 * whenever a merchant submits a fulfillment or cancellation request.
 *
 * Both merchants and apps can
 * [subscribe](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks)
 * to the
 * [fulfillment order webhooks](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/WebhookSubscriptionTopic#value-fulfillmentorderscancellationrequestaccepted)
 * to be notified whenever fulfillment order related domain events occur.

 * is created by a merchant or third party to represent the ongoing or completed work of fulfillment.
 *
 * [See below for more details on creating fulfillments](#the-lifecycle-of-a-fulfillment-order-at-a-location-which-is-managed-by-a-fulfillment-service).
 *
 * > Note:
 * > Shopify creates fulfillment orders automatically when an order is created.
 * > It is not possible to manually create fulfillment orders.
 * >
 * > [See below for more details on the lifecycle of a fulfillment order](#the-lifecycle-of-a-fulfillment-order).
 *
 * ## Retrieving fulfillment orders
 *
 * ### Fulfillment orders from an order
 *
 * All fulfillment orders related to a given order can be retrieved with the
 * [Order.fulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#connection-order-fulfillmentorders)
 * connection.
 *
 * [API access scopes](#api-access-scopes)
 * govern which fulfillments orders are returned to clients.
 * An API client will only receive a subset of the fulfillment orders which belong to an order
 * if they don't have the necessary access scopes to view all of the fulfillment orders.
 *
 * ### Fulfillment orders assigned to the app for fulfillment
 *
 * Fulfillment service apps can retrieve the fulfillment orders which have been assigned to their locations with the
 * [Shop.assignedFulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Shop#connection-shop-assignedfulfillmentorders)
 * connection.
 * Use the `assignmentStatus` argument to control whether all assigned fulfillment orders
 * should be returned or only those where a merchant has sent a
 * [fulfillment request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrderMerchantRequest)
 * and it has yet to be responded to.
 *
 * The API client must be granted the `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope to access
 * the assigned fulfillment orders.
 *
 * ### All fulfillment orders
 *
 * Apps can retrieve all fulfillment orders with the
 * [fulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/fulfillmentOrders)
 * query. This query returns all assigned, merchant-managed, and third-party fulfillment orders on the shop,
 * which are accessible to the app according to the
 * [fulfillment order access scopes](#api-access-scopes) it was granted with.
 *
 * ## The lifecycle of a fulfillment order
 *
 * ### Fulfillment Order Creation
 *
 * After an order is created, a background worker performs the order routing process which determines
 * which locations will be responsible for fulfilling the purchased items.
 * Once the order routing process is complete, one or more fulfillment orders will be created
 * and assigned to these locations. It is not possible to manually create fulfillment orders.
 *
 * Once a fulfillment order has been created, it will have one of two different lifecycles depending on
 * the type of location which the fulfillment order is assigned to.
 *
 * ### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a merchant managed location
 *
 * Fulfillment orders are completed by creating
 * [fulfillments](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment).
 * Fulfillments represents the work done.
 *
 * For digital products a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfilment once the digital asset
 * has been provisioned.
 * For example, in the case of a digital gift card, a merchant would to do this once
 * the gift card has been activated - before the email has been shipped.
 *
 * On the other hand, for a traditional shipped order,
 * a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfillment after picking and packing the items relating
 * to a fulfillment order, but before the courier has collected the goods.
 *
 * [Learn about managing fulfillment orders as an order management app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/order-management-apps/manage-fulfillments).
 *
 * ### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a location which is managed by a fulfillment service
 *
 * For fulfillment orders which are assigned to a location that is managed by a fulfillment service,
 * a merchant or an Order Management App can
 * [send a fulfillment request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitFulfillmentRequest)
 * to the fulfillment service which operates the location to request that they fulfill the associated items.
 * A fulfillment service has the option to
 * [accept](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderAcceptFulfillmentRequest)
 * or [reject](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderRejectFulfillmentRequest)
 * this fulfillment request.
 *
 * Once the fulfillment service has accepted the request, the request can no longer be cancelled by the merchant
 * or order management app and instead a
 * [cancellation request must be submitted](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitCancellationRequest)
 * to the fulfillment service.
 *
 * Once a fulfillment service accepts a fulfillment request,
 * then after they are ready to pack items and send them for delivery, they create fulfillments with the
 * [fulfillmentCreateV2](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentCreateV2)
 * mutation.
 * They can provide tracking information right away or create fulfillments without it and then
 * update the tracking information for fulfillments with the
 * [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdateV2](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdateV2)
 * mutation.
 *
 * [Learn about managing fulfillment orders as a fulfillment service](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments).
 *
 * ## API access scopes
 *
 * Fulfillment orders are governed by the following API access scopes:
 *
 * * The `read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and
 *   `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes
 *   grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations.
 * * The `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` and `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders`
 *   access scopes are intended for fulfillment services.
 *   These scopes grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to locations that are being managed
 *   by fulfillment services.
 * * The `read_third_party_fulfillment_orders` and `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
 *   access scopes grant access to fulfillment orders
 *   assigned to locations managed by other fulfillment services.
 *
 * ### Fulfillment service app access scopes
 *
 * Usually, **fulfillment services** have the `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope
 * and don't have the `*_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
 * or `*_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes.
 * The app will only have access to the fulfillment orders assigned to their location
 * (or multiple locations if the app registers multiple fulfillment services on the shop).
 * The app will not have access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations
 * or locations owned by other fulfillment service apps.
 *
 * ### Order management app access scopes
 *
 * **Order management apps** will usually request `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and
 * `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders` access scopes. This will allow them to manage all fulfillment orders
 * on behalf of a merchant.
 *
 * If an app combines the functions of an order management app and a fulfillment service,
 * then the app should request all
 * access scopes to manage all assigned and all unassigned fulfillment orders.
 *
 * ## Notifications about fulfillment orders
 *
 * Fulfillment services are required to
 * [register](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentService)
 * a self-hosted callback URL which has a number of uses. One of these uses is that this callback URL will be notified
 * whenever a merchant submits a fulfillment or cancellation request.
 *
 * Both merchants and apps can
 * [subscribe](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks)
 * to the
 * [fulfillment order webhooks](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/WebhookSubscriptionTopic#value-fulfillmentorderscancellationrequestaccepted)
 * to be notified whenever fulfillment order related domain events occur.
 *

/**
 * A **Fulfillment Service** is a third party warehouse that prepares and ships orders
 * on behalf of the store owner. Fulfillment services charge a fee to package and ship items
 * and update product inventory levels. Some well known fulfillment services with Shopify integrations
 * include: Amazon, Shipwire, and Rakuten. When an app registers a new `FulfillmentService` on a store,
 * Shopify automatically creates a `Location` that's associated to the fulfillment service.
 * To learn more about fulfillment services, refer to
 * [Manage fulfillments as a fulfillment service app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps)
 * guide.
 *
 * ## Mutations
 *
 * You can work with the `FulfillmentService` object with the
 * [fulfillmentServiceCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceCreate),
 * [fulfillmentServiceUpdate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceUpdate),
 * and [fulfillmentServiceDelete](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceDelete)
 * mutations.
 *
 * ## Hosted endpoints
 *
 * Fulfillment service providers integrate with Shopify by providing Shopify with a set of hosted endpoints that
 * Shopify can query on certain conditions.
 * These endpoints must have a common prefix, and this prefix should be supplied in the `callbackUrl` parameter
 * in the
 * [fulfillmentServiceCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceCreate)
 * mutation.
 *
 * - Shopify sends POST requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint
 *   to notify the fulfillment service about fulfillment requests and fulfillment cancellation requests,
 *   if `fulfillment_orders_opt_in` is set to `true`.
 *
 *   [As of the 2022-07 API version](https://shopify.dev/changelog/legacy-fulfillment-api-deprecation),
 *   it's mandatory for a fulfillment service to follow a fulfillment order based workflow by
 *   having `fulfillment_orders_opt_in` set to `true`,
 *   hosting the `<callbackUrl>/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint, and acting on fulfillment requests and cancellations.
 *
 *   For more information, refer to
 *   [Receive fulfillment requests and cancellations](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-2-receive-fulfillment-requests-and-cancellations).
 * - Shopify sends GET requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_tracking_numbers` endpoint to retrieve tracking numbers for orders,
 *   if `trackingSupport` is set to `true`.
 *
 *   For more information, refer to
 *   [Enable tracking support](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-8-enable-tracking-support-optional).
 *
 *   Fulfillment services can also update tracking information with the
 *   [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdateV2](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdateV2) mutation,
 *   rather than waiting for Shopify to ask for tracking numbers.
 * - Shopify sends GET requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_stock` endpoint to retrieve inventory levels,
 *   if `inventoryManagement` is set to `true`.
 *
 *   For more information, refer to
 *   [Sharing inventory levels with Shopify](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-9-share-inventory-levels-with-shopify-optional).
 *
 * To make sure you have everything set up correctly, you can test the `callbackUrl`-prefixed endpoints
 * in your development store.
 *
 * ## Resources and webhooks
 *
 * There are a variety of objects and webhooks that enable a fulfillment service to work.
 * To exchange fulfillment information with Shopify, fulfillment services use the
 * [FulfillmentOrder](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrder),
 * [Fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment) and
 * [Order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) objects and related mutations.
 * To act on fulfillment process events that happen on the Shopify side,
 * besides awaiting calls to `callbackUrl`-prefixed endpoints,
 * fulfillment services can subscribe to the
 * [fulfillment order](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks)
 * and [order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/webhook)
 * webhooks.

   * and will always remain assigned to the original location.
   *
   * You can't change the assigned location while a fulfillment order has a

   * of `SUBMITTED`, `ACCEPTED`, `CANCELLATION_REQUESTED`, or `CANCELLATION_REJECTED`.

   * This behavior is intended to prevent items from being fulfilled by multiple locations or fulfillment services.

   *
   * **First scenario:** Re-assign all line items belonging to a fulfillment order to a new location.

   * [assignedLocation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/fulfillmentorder#field-fulfillmentorder-assignedlocation)

   *
   * **Second scenario:** Re-assign a subset of the line items belonging to a fulfillment order to a new location.
   * You can specify a subset of line items using the `fulfillmentOrderLineItems` parameter
   * (available as of the `2023-04` API version),
   * or specify that the original fulfillment order contains line items which have already been fulfilled.
   *
   * If the new location is already assigned to another active fulfillment order, on the same order,
   * then the line items are moved to the existing fulfillment order.
   * Otherwise, a new fulfillment order is created for the new location, and the line items are moved to the new location.

   * The `ResourceFeedback` object lets your app report the status of shops and their resources. For example, if

   *
   * Resource feedback notifications are displayed to the merchant on the home screen of their Shopify admin, and in the product details view for any products that are published to your app.
   *
   * This resource should be used only in cases where you're describing steps that a merchant is required to complete. If your app offers optional or promotional set-up steps, or if it makes recommendations, then don't use resource feedback to let merchants know about them.
   *
   * ## Sending feedback on a shop
   *
   * You can send resource feedback on a shop to let the merchant know what steps they need to take to make sure that your app is set up correctly. Feedback can have one of two states: `requires_action` or `success`. You need to send a `requires_action` feedback request for each step that the merchant is required to complete.
   *
   * If there are multiple set-up steps that require merchant action, then send feedback with a state of `requires_action` as merchants complete prior steps. And to remove the feedback message from the Shopify admin, send a `success` feedback request.
   *
   * #### Important
   * Sending feedback replaces previously sent feedback for the shop. Send a new `shopResourceFeedbackCreate` mutation to push the latest state of a shop or its resources to Shopify.
