# Storefront E2E Contract

This package runs one Playwright suite against an already-running storefront. It uses live data only. It does not start a server, set environment variables, or mock Storefront API responses.

The runtime source of truth for test group prerequisites lives in specs/*/config.ts. Shared route and GraphQL validation lives in src/spec-config-validation.ts. Domain-specific setup and probes stay inline in the config or spec file that uses them. Error formatting lives in src/contract.ts; domain-specific messages live near the matcher or spec. This document explains the same contract for humans.

The suite uses a tokenless Hydrogen Storefront API client for read-only discovery. Discovery uses the Storefront API version bundled with Hydrogen. Storefront API failures stop the affected test group instead of falling back to DOM-only discovery. Cart and checkout discovery ignore subscription-only products and prefer variants that are available for sale.

Each test group validates its own prerequisites in config.ts before any test runs. Required product, cart, and checkout prerequisites fail their test group with an actionable message. Optional collection, collection filter, search, and product variant prerequisites skip their group when the storefront data or route is unavailable.

## Routes

The tested storefront must expose the routes required by each active test group. Route checks use a bounded fetch before the browser test runs so missing routes fail or skip with setup context instead of timing out deep in the test.

Default route expectations:

- /cart is required for default cart and checkout tests
- Product detail routes at /products/:handle are required for default product, cart, and checkout tests
- /collections/:handle is required for collection tests when a collection with products exists
- /search is required for search tests when in-stock products exist

Required groups fail on route HTTP failures; optional groups skip.

## Product Results

Collection and search pages must expose product cards as accessible links to product detail pages.

Current first-pass discovery assumes standard label strings and link paths. A future contract should add explicit storefront-owned signifiers so the suite can distinguish product results from unrelated product links without relying on labels alone.

## Collection Filters

At least one probed collection must expose a visible, enabled checkbox filter that changes the URL, returns products, and reduces the visible product-link count when selected. Filters may auto-submit or use a visible Apply filters/Show results button.

Filter labels must include a count like Color Red (4). The suite uses that count to choose a filter that narrows the visible product links, then asserts the filtered result count does not exceed the label count. Missing Storefront API filter data skips the collection filter group.

## Search

The search page must expose a searchbox. A visible button with an accessible name containing Search is supported; otherwise the suite submits the searchbox with Enter.

The suite discovers a live product title, searches for it, and verifies that product appears in visible results.

## Variant Options

At least one probed product must expose a selectable variant control.

Supported first-pass controls:

- Buttons with aria-pressed="false"
- Links to product URLs with selected option query parameters

The selected variant must be represented in the URL and must render as visible text after loading that URL directly.

## Cart Line Items

Cart lines must be visible list items containing the product title.

After Add to cart, the storefront must show a cart drawer dialog containing the added line before the suite navigates to the cart page.

Each line must expose:

- Variant text when the product has a non-default variant
- A quantity input
- A visible increase control named Increase or +
- A visible decrease control named Decrease or -
- A visible remove control named Remove

Accessible labels are preferred. Broad data-testid attributes should only be used when a semantic role or label cannot express the user-facing concept.

## Checkout Handoff

The checkout test verifies only the storefront-to-checkout handoff.

It clicks the visible checkout link, waits for the first checkout document, asserts the URL looks like checkout, and asserts the added product and variant are visible. It must not enter customer data, payment data, or any irreversible checkout step.

If checkout blocks before showing the product summary, the test fails as a contract or environment issue.

## Operations

Run with:

STOREFRONT_BASE_URL=https://your-storefront.example pnpm test:e2e:storefront

Set STOREFRONT_E2E_WORKERS to override the default parallel worker count.
The worker override must be an integer from 1 to 12.

Operational expectations:

- Use a development or example storefront, not a production merchant storefront unless explicitly accepted.
- The owner of STOREFRONT_BASE_URL is responsible for health, live data, cart, and checkout availability.
- Playwright runs headless and fully parallel by default.
- Artifacts are failure-only.
- If CI wiring is added, artifact upload must set explicit retention-days.
- Unit tests intentionally do not enforce coverage thresholds because this package's behavioral coverage is the live storefront contract suite. Add thresholds if non-e2e unit coverage becomes a quality signal for package code.

## Contract Migration

When the storefront contract changes, update the relevant spec matcher, shared helper, and this document together.

Generated examples should migrate toward explicit storefront-owned signifiers for product results, variant options, cart lines, and checkout summaries. Until then, the suite assumes label strings and semantic roles.
