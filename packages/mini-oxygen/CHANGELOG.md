# @shopify/mini-oxygen

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- Fix OAuth redirect handling and stabilize Customer Account API development flag ([#3082](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/3082)) by [@juanpprieto](https://github.com/juanpprieto)

  ## MiniOxygen: Fixed redirect handling for OAuth flows

  MiniOxygen now correctly handles external redirects by passing them to the browser instead of following them internally. This ensures OAuth/PKCE authentication flows work properly with React Router's `redirectDocument()` function.

  **What changed:**
  - Miniflare's `dispatchFetch` now uses `{redirect: 'manual'}` to prevent automatic redirect following
  - Fixed `Headers.getSetCookie()` method for proper multi-cookie support
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for redirect scenarios

  **Before:** External redirects were followed internally, breaking OAuth flows

  ```js
  // Redirects were automatically followed by Miniflare
  const response = await mf.dispatchFetch(request);
  ```

  **After:** Redirects are passed to the browser for proper handling

  ```js
  // Redirects are now returned as-is for the browser to handle
  const response = await mf.dispatchFetch(request, {redirect: 'manual'});
  ```

  ## CLI: Stabilized Customer Account API development flag

  The `--customer-account-push` flag is now stable and ready for production use. This flag enables tunneling for local development with Customer Account API OAuth flows.

  **Before:**

  ```bash
  # Flag was experimental with __unstable suffix
  shopify hydrogen dev --customer-account-push__unstable
  ```

  **After:**

  ```bash
  # Flag is now stable
  shopify hydrogen dev --customer-account-push

  # Or use environment variable
  SHOPIFY_HYDROGEN_FLAG_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_PUSH=true npm run dev
  ```

  This flag automatically:
  - Creates a tunnel for your local development server
  - Configures the Customer Account API OAuth callback URLs
  - Enables testing of the full authentication flow locally

### Minor Changes

- Upgrade Miniflare from v2 to v4 in mini-oxygen package. ([#3039](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/3039)) by [@kdaviduik](https://github.com/kdaviduik)
  - Internal MiniOxygen API has been refactored to work with Miniflare v4's new architecture.
  - Simplified MiniOxygen class - no longer extends MiniflareCore.
  - Updated global fetch handling to use Miniflare v4's `outboundService` API.
  - Fixed test infrastructure to use project-relative temporary directories.
  - Added support for Oxygen compatibility parameters (`compatibilityDate`, `compatibilityFlags`).
  - Removed dependency on multiple `@miniflare/*` packages in favor of the consolidated `miniflare` package.

### Patch Changes

  If your proxy uses authentication, provide the auth in the following format:

  ```bash
  SHOPIFY_HTTP_PROXY=http://user:pass@yourproxy.com:PORT
  ```

- [**Breaking change**] by [@wizardlyhel](https://github.com/wizardlyhel)

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- The default runtime exported from `@shopify/mini-oxygen` is now based on workerd. ([#1891](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1891)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  The previous Node.js sandbox runtime has been moved to the `@shopify/mini-oxygen/node` export.

  Example usage:

  ```js
  import {createMiniOxygen} from '@shopify/mini-oxygen';

  const miniOxygen = createMiniOxygen({
    workers: [
      {
        name: 'main',
        modules: true,
        script: `export default {
          async fetch() {
            const response = await fetch("https://hydrogen.shopify.dev");
            return response;
          }
        }`,
      },
    ],
  });

  const response = await miniOxygen.dispatchFetch('http://placeholder');
  console.log(await response.text());

  await miniOxygen.dispose();
  ```

### Minor Changes

- Export new Vite plugin from `@shopify/mini-oxygen/vite`. It integrates Vite with MiniOxygen by running the application code within a worker. ([#1935](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1935)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

## 2.2.5

### Patch Changes

- Fix step-debugging when running in the Node.js sandbox ([#1501](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1501)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

## 2.2.4

### Patch Changes

- Update all Node.js dependencies to version 18. (Not a breaking change, since Node.js 18 is already required by Remix v2.) ([#1543](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1543)) by [@michenly](https://github.com/michenly)

- Fix how peer dependencies are resolved. ([#1489](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1489)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

## 2.2.3

### Patch Changes

- Increase the request body size limit to 100mb when running locally. ([#1421](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1421)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

## 2.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 8863d40: Update @types/connect from 3.4.35 to 3.4.36

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- fc405c0: Fix error stack traces when using `script` option. The sourcemap for the script is loaded using the path passed in `workerFile`.
- df9af93: Add `request-id` header to requests like in Oxygen production.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 11a5d6c: - Add a `globalFetch` option to allow for custom fetch implementations.
  - Allow returning responses from the `onRequest` hook to intercept requests. This allows for custom handling of requests in a Node.js environment without going into the app sandbox. When returning a response from `onRequest`, the `onResponse` hook will not be called.
  - Pass a `defaultDispatcher` function as the second parameter to the `onRequest` hook. Calling this function will dispatch the request to the app sandbox as usual and return the response within the context of the hook. This is useful to wrap each request handling in AsyncLocalStorage.

## 2.1.3

- 9e3e87b: Update prettier from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1

  Expose `MiniOxygenOptions` type.
- c23dcbe: Expose the internal `createMiniOxygen` function to create a MiniOxygen instance without starting a server.
  The function `startServer` has not changed.

## 2.0.1

- d9cb363: Update inquirer from 9.2.8 to 9.2.9
- d86b580: Update eslint from 8.45.0 to 8.46.0

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 33dc296: - Mini Oxygen can no longer be used in a standalone fashion
  - It is now built as ESM module
  - Support for the JSON based configuration file is dropped and as such the `oxygen-gen-config` command no longer exists
  - The `preview` function has been renamed to `startServer`
  - `startServer` is now a named export

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Add reload method that sets new env vars and reloads Miniflare.
- 8572625: Add compatability date to match production version of Oxygen

## 1.6.0

- Change minioxygen's events route to avoid conflicts with actual routes. ([PR](https://github.com/Shopify/mini-oxygen/pull/436))

## 1.5.0

- Dependency updates
- Re add hooks that were accidently removed. ([PR](https://github.com/Shopify/mini-oxygen/pull/416))
- Added ability to set oxygen headers along with default values for them ([PR](https://github.com/Shopify/mini-oxygen/pull/417))

## 1.4.0

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 0530ad2: Downgrade get-port to a non esm version

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c6b07bd: The `ui` object is deprecated in favor of a single `log` function. The deprecated object had one accepted method, `say`, that handled logging, so this change simplifies the interface.

  The `ui.say` was a relic from the first version of the Hydrogen CLI package (now removed in favor of the Shopify CLI) and we no longer need to abide by the restrictions imposed by that dependent package.

### Patch Changes

- b7a00c2: - Enables streams constructor compatibility.
  - Upgrades Miniflare dependencies to 2.8.2.
