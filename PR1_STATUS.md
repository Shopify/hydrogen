# PR1 Status: Remix-Oxygen Updates

## Summary
PR1 (Remix-Oxygen Package Updates) has been **completed as part of PR0**.

## Analysis

After creating the `feat/remix-oxygen-rr-7.8` branch and reviewing the `@shopify/remix-oxygen` package, we found that:

1. ✅ **Version Pinning**: Already updated to React Router 7.8.2 in package.json
   - `devDependencies`: `react-router: "7.8.2"`
   - `peerDependencies`: `react-router: "7.8.2"`

2. ✅ **Import Updates**: All imports already use `react-router` (not old `@remix-run/*` packages)
   - `src/index.ts`: Exports types and utilities from `react-router`
   - `src/server.ts`: Imports from `react-router`
   - `src/event-logger.ts`: No React Router imports needed

3. ✅ **Build & Test**: Package builds and typechecks successfully
   - `npm run build`: Success
   - `npm run typecheck`: No errors

## Conclusion

The `@shopify/remix-oxygen` package was already fully updated for React Router 7.8.2 compatibility as part of PR0 (version pinning). No additional changes are needed.

## Next Steps

Since PR1 is effectively complete:
1. We can proceed directly to PR2 (Hydrogen-React Updates)
2. The PR1 branch (`feat/remix-oxygen-rr-7.8`) can be deleted as it contains no new changes
3. Update the migration strategy to note that PR1 was included in PR0

## Files Changed
None - all necessary changes were already included in PR0:
- `packages/remix-oxygen/package.json` (version updates only)
