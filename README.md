## Versioning

Hydrogen and hydrogen-react are tied to specific versions of the [Shopify Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/api/storefront), which follows [calver](https://calver.org/).

For example, if you're using Storefront API version `2025-04`, then Hydrogen and hydrogen-react versions `2025.4.x` are fully compatible.

If the Storefront API version update includes breaking changes, then Hydrogen and hydrogen-react may also include breaking changes. Because the API version is updated every three months, breaking changes could occur every three months.
