# Hydrogen examples

The example apps in this directory show how to implement popular design patterns in Hydrogen.

Each example only contains the files that are different from Hydrogen’s [Skeleton template](/templates/skeleton/), but it's still possible to inspect and run them locally. See each example's README file for details on the problem it solves, how the solution works, and any other requirements you’ll need.

Examples are kept intentionally minimal, containing only the new and updated code required to illustrate a working use case.

### Creating new examples as diffs

An example diff is a partial Hydrogen app that only contains the files that change from the skeleton template. The Hydrogen CLI will merge the example diff on top of the skeleton template in a temporary directory before running the `dev` or `build` commands.

Keep the following in mind when creating a new example diff:

1. Start a new example diff by copying another minimal example and changing code.
   Only include and commit files that are different from the skeleton template.
1. `package.json` must always be created with a unique name with example- prefix.
1. `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `peerDependencies` in `package.json` are also merged to those in skeleton. Therefore, only list new or modified dependencies in the example.
1. The scripts in `package.json` must pass the `--diff` flag to the `dev` and `build` commands. Otherwise, it will be treated as a full Hydrogen app instead of a diff.
1. The `tsconfig.json` must have special values. Copy it from another existing diff example.
1. Add the example package to `workspaces` option in the main repo package.json
1. Add the new example in this README
