# Hydrogen example: B2B

> [!NOTE]
> This example is currently Unstable. There is a known issue where setting too many [Customer Account API callback URIs](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/building-with-the-customer-account-api/hydrogen#update-the-application-setup) will cause the hydrogen session to exceed the browsers maximum cookie length. This is because our current implementation relies on encoding redirect URIs in the token. We are aware of this issue and are actively working towards a future where this is not a problem. As a workaround you can remove unneeded callback URIs or use a different storefront.

This is an example implementation of a B2B storefront using Hydrogen. It includes the following high level changes.

1. Retrieving company location data from a logged in customer using the [Customer Account API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/customer/2024-07/queries/customer)
2. Displaying a list of company locations and setting a `companyLocationId` in session
3. Using a storefront `customerAccessToken` and `companyLocationId` to update cart and get B2B specific rules and pricing such as [volume pricing and quantity rules](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/b2b/catalogs/quantity-pricing)
4. Using a storefront `customerAccessToken` and `companyLocationId` to [contextualize queries](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront#directives) using the `buyer` argument on the product display page

> [!NOTE]
> Only queries on the product display page, `app/routes/products.$handle.tsx`, were contextualized in this example. For a production storefront, all queries for product data should be contextualized.

## Install

Setup a new project with this example:

```bash
npm create @shopify/hydrogen@latest -- --template b2b
```

## Requirements

- Your store is on a [Shopify Plus plan](https://help.shopify.com/manual/intro-to-shopify/pricing-plans/plans-features/shopify-plus-plan).
- Your store is using [new customer accounts](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/customers/customer-accounts/new-customer-accounts).
- You have access to a customer which has permission to order for a [B2B company](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/b2b).

## Key files

This folder contains the minimal set of files needed to showcase the implementation.
Not all queries where contextualized for B2B. `app/routes/products.$handle.tsx` provides
reference on how to contextualize storefront queries. Files that aren’t included by default
with Hydrogen and that you’ll need to create are labeled with 🆕.
