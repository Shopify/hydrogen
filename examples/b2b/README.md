# Hydrogen example: B2B

This is an example implementation of a B2B storefront using Hydrogen. It includes the following high level changes.

1. Retrieving company location data from a logged in customer using the [Customer Account API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/customer/2024-07/queries/customer)
2. Displaying a list of company locations and setting a `companyLocationId` in session
3. Using a storefront `customerAccessToken` and `companyLocationId` to update cart and get B2B specific rules and pricing such as [volume pricing and quantity rules](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/b2b/catalogs/quantity-pricing)
4. Using a storefront `customerAccessToken` and `companyLocationId` to [contextualize queries](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront#directives) using the `buyer` argument on the product display page

> [!NOTE]
> Only queries on the product display page, `app/routes/products.$handle.tsx`, were contextualized in this example. For a production storefront, all queries for product data should be contextualized.

## Install

Setup a new project with this example:

```bash
npm create @shopify/hydrogen@latest -- --template b2b
```

## Requirements

- Your store is on a [Shopify Plus plan](https://help.shopify.com/manual/intro-to-shopify/pricing-plans/plans-features/shopify-plus-plan).
- Your store is using [new customer accounts](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/customers/customer-accounts/new-customer-accounts).
- You have access to a customer which has permission to order for a [B2B company](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/b2b).
